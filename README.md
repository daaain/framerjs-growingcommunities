## Growing Communities mobile app

Playing around with [Sketch](http://www.sketchapp.com/) and [Framer.js](http://framerjs.com), creating a mobile app for the ever brilliant [Growing Communities](http://www.growingcommunities.org/)

### Ideas / structure

Launch screen (basic features)

  * My account (personal and payment details)
  * Vegetable bags (available bags plus what’s in this week’s)
  * Collection points (map and list with capacity, address and opening times)
  * Collection share (neighbours (to send friend request), friends, messages, notification settings, opt-in to share rough location)

More features

  * Recipes (filter to this week’s produce in your bag)
  * Events (embed same thing as website)
  * Growing (sites and volunteering)
  * Farmers’ market (basic info and map)
